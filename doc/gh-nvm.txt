INTRODUCTION                                                              *gh-intro*

GH.nvim, initially, is a plugin for interactive code reviews which take place
on the GitHub platform. 

This plugin was created due to the repeat frustration of performing code reviews
of complex changes in the GitHub web UI. 

The mentioned frustration seemed to boil down to a few major drawbacks which GH.nvim
sets out to fix. These are:

1) Lack of context during code review
    When viewing a pull request in a large code base its very likely that you're
    not sure of the full context of the change. The patch may change the way a 
    function works, but you are not aware all the places this function may be 
    called. Its difficult to safely say that the patch is OK and approve it.

    To alleviate this, GH.nvim will make the pull request code locally available
    on your file system.

2) Lack of sufficient editor tools like LSP
    Because the pull request's code is made locally available all your LSP tools
    work as normal. 

    In my previous point, this means performing a LSP call to understand all the 
    usages of the editing function is now possible. 

3) Lack of automation when attempting to view the full context of a pull request.
    GH.nvim automates the process of making the pull request's code locally available.
    To do this, GH.nvim embeds a `git` CLI wrapper. 

    When a pull request is opened in GH.nvim the remote is added locally, the 
    branch is fetched, and the repo is checked out to the pull request's HEAD.

4) Inability to edit and run the code in the pull request.
    Because the pull request's code is made available locally, its completely 
    editable in your familiar `neovim` instance. 

    This works for both for writing reviews and responding to reviews of your
    pull request. 

    You can build up a diff while responding to review comments, stash them, 
    check out your branch, and rebase those changes into your PR and push again.
    Much handier then jumping back and forth between `neovim` and a browser.

    Additionally, since the code is local and checked out on your file system,
    you can now run any local development environments that may exist. The 
    environment will be running the pull request's code and you can perform sanity
    checks easily.

GH.nvim is a "commit-wise" review tool. This means you browse the changed files
by their commits. This will feel familiar to those who immediately click on the
"commits" tab on the GitHub UI to view the incremental changes of the pull request.

GH.nvim holds the opinion that this is the correct way to do a code review and 
and the TUI emphasizes this workflow.

====================================================================================
Usage And Features                                                        *gh-usage*

GH.nvim initially focuses on pull request code reviews. The plugin has been designed
to make the process of review coding seamless with `neovim` editing. The following 
walk through will give a overview of GH.nvim's features and how to use the.

Dependencies:
    GH.nvim relies on the `litee.nvim` framework for building its plugin surface.
    You must include this package for GH.nvim to work.
    https://github.com/ldelossa/litee.nvim

    Additionally, both the `git` and `gh` CLI tools are required for the plugin
    to interface with the git repository and the GitHub API respectively.
    For GitHub Enterprise, make sure to set the environment variable `GH_HOST`.
    https://git-scm.com/
    https://github.com/cli/cli

    It is not mandatory but *highly* recommended to use GH.nvim with either 
    fzf.lua or telescope. This is because GH.nvim uses `vim.ui.select` for most
    of its users inputs. By utilizing fzf.lua or telescope you can configure both
    to override `vim.ui.select` function and provide a fuzzy searcher over all 
    input selections GH.nvim creates. 

    I'm personally an fzf.lua user and you can make this work by adding the following
    line to your fzf.lua config:
        `lua vim.cmd("FzfLua register_ui_select")` 

    GH.nvim is best used with a patched font. Ideally, the patch font has codicons
    support, but icons will work fine with nerd font patches as well.

Code Review Environment:
    GH.nvim *will* modify the `git` repository at the root of the directory 
    `neovim` has been opened too. 

    These modifications include adding the pull request's remotes, checking out
    branches, removing the pull request remotes, and fetching remote content. 

    The suggested way to use `GH.nvim` would be to create a worktree of the target
    repository for code review purposes. If you are not familiar with worktrees,
    they are "linked" but separate repository directories. This allows you to make
    changes to branches without the potential for any issues on our main repository.

    An example using `neovim`'s repo on my system would look like this:

    ```
    $ cd ~/git/c/neovim
    $ git worktree add ../neovim-code-review
    $ cd ../neovim-code-review
    ```
    After the `cd` my host system is inside a git worktree, GH.nvim can modify 
    this repository's `git` state without effecting the original "main" repository.

    This is only a suggestion, GH.nvim will not perform any data loosing operations
    on the underlying repository, however just to be sure, especially while GH.nvim
    is in beta, its suggested to use the worktree approach.

    Additionally, you must be aware of how git will fetch a repository. 

    gh.nvim will use the git_protocol defined in your gh config.
    Run `gh config get git_protocol` to see the current protocol.

Configuration:
    A simplest possible configuration, using all the defaults, will look like 
    this:

    require('litee.lib').setup()
    require('litee.gh').setup()

    This will first configure the `litee.nvim` library and then configure GH.nvim.
    All defaults will be used. For further configuration information see `h: gh-configuration`

Opening a PR:
    After configuring GH.nvim you can open `neovim` to the base repository hosting
    the pull request you'd like to review, or create a review to. 

    The `GHOpenPR` command will open a `vim.ui.select` UI with the first 100 pull
    requests for selection. 

    On selection the main GH.nvim UI will load and present you with a `litee.nvim` 
    panel presenting the PR's details and a buffer with the PR meta data and issue
    comments will be presented. 

The Panel:
    The panel loaded will display some key information. At a high level you'll see
    several trees, outlined below are the ones of most importance. 

    Each section will be described with an example of the tree layout in the 
    panel using a test PR I created for this purpose.

    By default, if the node supports it, pressing the "d" key show a details
    popup with some information. This is useful for quickly displaying comments
    and commit messages.

    Details:
           #1 update readme with first update
            Details:
         ⎸     number:
         ⎸     author:
         ⎸     state:
         ⎸     repo:
         ⎸     base:
         ⎸     head:
         ⎸    labels:
         ⎸ ⎸     bug
         ⎸    assignees:
         ⎸ ⎸     ldelossa
    
        Details describes the general information of the pull request. 
        By hitting "return" on the very first item you'll always be brought
        back to the main pull request buffer. 

        At the main pull request buffer you can see any comments not associated
        with any file diffs, the title of the PR and the body. You can modify
        comments along with edit the title and body of the PR if you authored it.

    Commits:
            Commits:
         ⎸     f86c5d09
         ⎸     943cb016
         ⎸     d0b9c794
         ⎸     37d5f671
         ⎸     0e6ee395

        The commits section displays each commit of the pull request. By hitting
        "return" one one of the commits you'll be taken to a diff of the first
        file changed in the commit and a new panel will open outlining the files
        changed within a commit.

        This is the main way of reviewing code in GH.nvim, you'll move between
        commits and review the changes.

    Conversations:
            Conversations:
         ⎸    newfile:267
         ⎸    newfile:261
         ⎸ ⎸     comment by ldelossa
         ⎸ ⎸     reply by ldelossa
         ⎸ ⎸     reply by ldelossa
         ⎸ ⎸     reply by ldelossa

        The conversations section outlines all conversation threads associated
        with the pull request. 

        By hitting "return" on any of the comments in a thread you'll be brought
        to the diff view with the conversation present for viewing.

    There are other trees that will appear if the data is there, such as "requested reviewers"
    and "assignees". They are mostly informative.

The Diff View:
    
    The diff view presents patch changes between old and new files. A diff view
    can be used to view the changes of the pull request, review conversations on
    particular lines of a pull request, and create new conversations on particular
    lines of a pull request.

    The diff view will paint icons in the sign columns where comments can be 
    created. To create a comment ensure your mouse is on a line with the "+" mark
    and use the "GHCreateThread" command.

    When the cursor is on a line with with a comment, indicated by a sign in the 
    sign column, you may use the `GHToggleThread` command to open and close it. 
    If there are multiple comments on a line you may move to the next one with 
    the `GHNextThread` command.
    
Convo Buffers:
    
    Conversations happen in various "convo buffers". These buffers provide a way
    to write, edit, and remove comments for a particular diff line or for the 
    pr as a whole. 

    Convo buffers are only modifiable in the text region at the end of the file,
    once text is provided hitting `ctrl-s` will submit the text. 

    Use `ctrl-a` when the cursor is on a comment to open a menu with various
    actions you can perform on a comment.

Code Reviews:
    
    GH.nvim works just like the GitHub UI.

    When a code review has not been started all replies to threads or creations of threads 
    are issued outside of a review. 

    When a code review is started, all comments to threads or creation of threads occur as
    pending until you submit the review. You'll notice this in the panel, as new messages 
    you create are marked as pending.

    If you close GH.nvim and open the PR again without submitting your review, the review
    will automatically be entered. This is the same as GitHub's UI, you'll always be in the
    review until you explicitly submit or cancel the review.

    You can create a review with the `GHStartReview` command, submit it with the `GHSubmitReview` 
    command and cancel it with the `GHCancelReview` command.

    Submitted code reviews show up in the panel as well. They are selectable, and when selected
    a new panel is opened which groups the conversation threads by the pull request review.
